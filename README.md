# QBank Remote Manager

QBank Remote Manager is a local Moodle plugin that extends the Moodle Web Services API to allow **remote management of the Question Bank and Quizzes**.

It is primarily designed for integrations with external systems that need to:
- upload questions into Moodle Question Bank,
- create quizzes programmatically,
- assign imported questions to quizzes,
- retrieve available question categories.

The plugin uses **standard Moodle core APIs** and respects Moodle capability and context checks.

2. Obtain the `itemid`
3. Call one of the provided web service functions with the `itemid`
4. The plugin processes and imports the file internally
